        <!-- Paragraph -->
        <p>Over two years ago, I decided to create my own game website for me and my friends to play games when we were bored at school, while also improving my HTML skills. After some time of updating the site and learning more about web development, I was able to platform my own games, like Troll Platformer 2-3 and Gambling Sim, and figured out how to get around blocks when they happened. Eventually, I had a sort of "monopoly" on game websites, outlasting all the blocks. People I didn’t even know recognized me because of Poopy Games, and it was a lot of fun and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

However, as Poopy Games got more popular, the blocks started happening more often, from once a month, to once a week, then every day, and even multiple times a day. I was managing fine until they blocked GitHub.io, which, in case you don’t know, hosted about 95% of game websites, including Poopy Games. There are other options for hosting, but with the popularity of Poopy Games, those might also be at risk in the future.

Later on I will add a final version of Poopy Games which will not have any updates to it created by me, Lizzyben, and I won’t be providing any more links if this one gets blocked. It truly was fun while it lasted, and I hope you can find something similar to be known for. If you're interested, the repository with all the code and files is publicly available <a href="https://github.com/Lizzyben1/poopygamesbeta">on my GitHub account</a> for you to fork and create your own version of the website. Truly, thank you.</p>
